  StudentBotHelper is a Discord bot primarily aimed at College and University students to both relieve them of menial and repetitive work (e.g. logging due dates), and to centralize a lot of resources they find useful onto one platform. In 2023, a lot of student, incuding myself, use Discord for purposes ranging from gaming to school. Therefore, a Discord bot that is aimed at assisting specifically students will garner a lot of interest and be appreciated by a large chunk of Discord users.

  <!-- PURPOSE OF PROJECT -->
  ## Purpose of project

  The purpose of StudentHelperBot is to assist students in their studies, whether it be finding information about their educational institution, logging due dates, forming group chats to work collaboratively with their friends on assignments, or just lounge around to get the general vibe of their school. The following features built into StudentBotHelper include the following:
    1. Registering an account to use with the bot
    2. Creating a private 'thread' session with the bot. This simulates a real session that you would typically establish if you were using a web application
    3. Creating a private group dm with bot and up to 4 other users.
    4. Generating a google maps uri for information of a specific place (utilizes the google places api)
    5. Generating a google maps uri for directions from one place to another place (utilizes the google directions api)
    6. Deleting your user account (if the account is associated with your discord username)
    7. Typing the '/help' command to get more information about what commands can be used with the bot
    8. Having Discord events created automatically for classes in the present or future

  ## Getting started
  <p>The following section gives you instructions on the prerequisites you need to set up StudentBotHelper locally on your own Discord server</p>

  #### If on Windows:
    <p>Click on the download button that says 'Recommended for Most Users' as the bottom text.</p>

  #### If on MacOS:
    <p>Click on the Nodejs download link <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">here</a>. Once you are at the Nodejs downloads page, click on the download button which says 'macOS Installer'</p>  

  #### If on Linux
    <p>Click on the Nodejs download link <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">here</a>. Once you are at the Nodejs downloads page, you have one of two options for installers:
